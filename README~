This program calculates the spectrum of the Hydrogen atom
using the simple bisection method, i.e. it calculates the 
values of E for which the radial wavefunction goes to zero 
far from the origin. Second derivative in the Schr√∂dinger 
equation is evaluated with the finite difference method leading
to a recursion relation which is used when calculating the value
the radial equation far from origin. The iteration of the radial 
solution is separated into its own subroutine.

Compilation and running:
